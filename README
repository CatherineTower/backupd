============================== BACKUPD ==============================

A simple SyncToy-like backup daemon which reads from configuration
files and copies changed files at a set interval.

By default, the daemon reads from a configuration file in the home
directory named ".backupconfig" and creates a job queue from it. It
then waits in the background until the next specified time and then
runs the backup.

The guiding mantra throughout development of this application has been
to prioritize creating a working product over efficiency or
elegance. The code can -- and will -- be refactored over time to make
it more readable and more efficient, more flexible and configurable,
more verbose and stable. But to start out, at least, having a working
product is the only goal.

The unit tests have been written such that they are specific to my
machine. They walk the directory of a source tree that I've got in my
home directory. If you're going to write and test this application,
please change the paths in the unit tests to work on your machine
(and, ideally, to point to a directory you can restore if something
goes wrong).

As of now, the application may be Linux-specific. I don't think I
relied on any Posix-only D functions, but I'm not making any
guarantees.
